# DMCA POLICY

**Digital Millennium Copyright Act Compliance Policy**

**Last Updated:** February 14, 2026

---

## Overview

NeXtv ("we," "our," or "us") respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same. In compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. § 512, we have adopted this policy concerning copyright infringement.

## Important Notice About Our Service

**NeXtv is a content aggregator application that DOES NOT host, store, transmit, or control any of the content accessible through the App.**

- We provide a media player interface for users to connect to third-party IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) services
- All content (live TV, movies, series, VOD) is hosted, transmitted, and controlled by independent third-party IPTV service providers
- We do not upload, maintain, or have editorial control over any streaming content
- We do not provide, recommend, or maintain lists of IPTV servers or content sources

### Where Content Actually Resides

If you believe that copyrighted content is being illegally distributed:

1. **The content is hosted by the third-party IPTV provider**, not by NeXtv
2. **Copyright claims should be directed to the IPTV service provider** that is actually hosting and transmitting the content
3. **We cannot remove content** that we do not host or control

### What We Do
- Provide a software application (media player) for streaming video

## DMCA Notification Procedure

If you believe that your copyrighted work is being infringed and is accessible through NeXtv, we will address your concerns, but please understand our limitations.

### Before Filing a DMCA Notice

**IMPORTANT**: Please determine the actual source of the infringing content:

1. **Is the content hosted by NeXtv?** NO - We do not host any content
2. **Is the content provided by a third-party IPTV service?** YES - Contact that service provider directly
3. **Does NeXtv have the ability to remove the content?** NO - We cannot remove content we don't host

### When to Contact NeXtv

Contact us if:
- You believe NeXtv's software itself (not third-party content) infringes your copyright
- You have evidence that NeXtv is actively promoting or facilitating access to specific infringing content
- You believe user-generated content within our app (reviews, comments, avatars) infringes your copyright
- A third-party IPTV provider is unresponsive and you need assistance identifying them

### When to Contact the IPTV Provider

Contact the IPTV provider directly if:
- Copyrighted content is being streamed through their service
- They are hosting, transmitting, or distributing infringing material
- You want the content removed from their servers
